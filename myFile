In the realm of keys and code,
Where silence speaks and lines unfold,
A tool stands timeless, pure, and lean,
The poet's pen, the coder's dream.

No mouse to guide, no menus bright,
Just keystrokes dancing in the night.
With gentle taps and subtle art,
Vim carves its way into the heart.

Escape to normal, where commands reside,
Effortless motions, where fingers glide.
With h, j, k, and l, we roam,
In this minimalistic, quiet home.

Insert whispers, modes of change,
Yet no complexity feels strange.
For every task, a seamless flow,
In Vim's embrace, productivity grows.

From simple edits to complex feats,
Vim's magic in every beat.
A canvas plain, yet rich in might,
Where text and thought in harmony unite.

So here's to Vim, both old and new,
A coder's sanctuary, tried and true.
In its simplicity, we find our song,
With Vim, our words and code belong.
