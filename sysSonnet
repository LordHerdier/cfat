In tangled webs of code, the night is spent,
A weary soul before the glowing screen.
With every line, the mind and heart are bent,
To fix the faults unseen, yet keenly seen.

The compiler's cryptic cries fill the air,
In loops of logic, errors ever dwell.
The burden heavy, more than one can bear,
In silent, sleepless nights of coding hell.

Through stacks and heaps, the mind does ever roam,
To trace the bugs that hide in shadows deep.
The memory leaks, the faults that steal one's home,
And dreams of perfect code that haunt their sleep.

Yet in this strife, a beauty does reside,
For in the quest, true mastery does hide.
